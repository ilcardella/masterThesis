Description of the GEF Framework with code examples
\\
Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) provides a powerful foundation for creating editors for visual editing of arbitrary models. Its effectiveness lies in a modular build, fitting use of design patterns, and decoupling of components that comprise a full, working editor. To a newcomer, the sheer number and variety of concepts and techniques present in GEF may feel intimidating. However, once learned and correctly used, they help to develop highly scalable and easy to maintain software. This section aims to provide a gentle yet comprehensive introduction to GEF. It describes our Pluto Graphical Editor.
